## 🔥 Projects

### 🏋️ FitAI: ML-Powered Workout Coach
A breakthrough in personalized fitness technology that merges machine learning algorithms with accessible user interfaces. FitAI dynamically generates customized exercise routines and provides real-time form analysis through computer vision, creating a virtual personal trainer experience that adapts to individual needs. The system employs a sophisticated pipeline from workout generation through video analysis, offering instantaneous corrective feedback to improve exercise technique and effectiveness.

### 📰 Fake News Detector
An end-to-end pipeline for fake news classification that processes text data through multiple stages: web scraping → preprocessing → feature extraction (TF-IDF, BERT embeddings) → model training (ensemble of LSTM and Transformer models) → evaluation → deployment. Achieves 93% accuracy on unseen articles by combining linguistic pattern recognition with contextual understanding. The pipeline runs on Airflow with continuous retraining for evolving misinformation patterns.

### 💡 Lofi Mood Setter
A Spotify-powered app that curates personalized lofi playlists based on user mood and activity.

### 🏀 NBA Win Probability Predictor
A real-time machine learning model predicting NBA game outcomes with 70% accuracy.

### 🌍 English-to-Punjabi Translator
A Streamlit app powered by OpenAI, simplifying English-to-Punjabi translations for better accessibility.
